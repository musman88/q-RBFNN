# q-RBFNN
MATLAB codes for the comparison, convergence and sensitivity analysis of q-RBFNN
To perform the convergence analysis, run qRBF_Mean_Convergence_Analysis.m. The code is executed for three different values of q.

Sensitivity analysis can be performed by running the qRBF_SensitivityAnalysis_Final.m file.
Finally the performance comparison of the proposed method with contemporary techniques on different applications can be evaluated by running Channel_Estimation_qRBF.m 
and Plant_Identification_Comp.m files
